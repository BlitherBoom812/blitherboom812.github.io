# Probability
## Introduction

## Probability Space

Probability space is a triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbf{P})$, comprised of the following three
elements:

1 Sample space $\Omega$: the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment

2 $\sigma$-algebra (or $\sigma$-field) $\mathcal F$: a collection of subsets of $\Omega$

3 Probability measure $\mathbf P$: a function that assigns a nonnegative
probability to every set in the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal F$

### Sample space
Mutually exclusive

Collectively exhaustive

### $\sigma$-algegra

not unique

### Borel field

used to measure intervals
